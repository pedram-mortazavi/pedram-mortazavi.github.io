I am looking for 1-2 highly motivated Ph.D. students for Spring/Fall 2024/2025 semesters (starting in January/September). The positions are in the Department of Civil, Environmental, and Geo-Engineering at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.
 
I encourage those with a passion for Structural Resilience and Sustainability, Steel Structures, Mass-Timber Structures, Large-Scale Testing, Advanced Simulation Methods, to apply.
 
Areas of research interest, though not limited to, are:
-      Structural Resilience
-      Steel Structures
-      Large-Scale Testing
-      Development of Cast Steel Energy Dissipative Systems
-      Development of Passive Control Systems such as Damping and Isolation Systems
-      Development of Self-Centering Structural System and Mitigation of Residual Deformations
-      Validation and Codification of New Structural Systems
-      Advanced Simulation Methods and Numerical Modelling
-      Hybrid Simulation
-      Multi-Platform Simulation
-      Mass-Timber Structures
 
Preferred candidates should have strong background in fundamentals of structural engineering and excellent communication skills. Previous experience in Large-Scale Testing and simulation using OpenSees, Abaqus, Matlab, LabVIEW, etc. will be considered an asset. 
 
If interested, please reach out to me via email at pmortaza[at]umn.edu with the subject line: “Prospective PhD Student [Name]”. Please include a CV, a statement of research interests, and an academic transcript.
